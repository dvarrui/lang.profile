# Class-based

* In class-based languages the classes are defined beforehand and the objects are instantiated based on the classes.
* If two objects apple and orange are instantiated from the class Fruit, they are inherently fruits and it is guaranteed that you may handle them in the same way.
* e.g. a programmer can expect the existence of the same attributes such as `color` or `sugar_content` or `is_ripe`.

* Ruby example [person.rb](person.rb)
