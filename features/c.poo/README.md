# Object-oriented programming (OOP)

* Is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects".
* Objects can contain data and code
    * data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties),
    * and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).
* An object's own procedures can access and often modify the data fields of itself (objects have a notion of this or self)
* In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.
* OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.



Languages called "pure" OO languages, because everything in them is treated consistently as an object, from primitives such as characters and punctuation, all the way up to whole classes, prototypes, blocks, modules, etc. They were designed specifically to facilitate, even enforce, OO methods. Examples: Ruby, Scala, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Emerald,[22] JADE, Self, Raku.
